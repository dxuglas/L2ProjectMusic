# Musi

Musi is a free audio player designed for people who enjoy the user friendly
experience and design of popular music streaming platforms, but don't support
the predatory subscription model they enforce. 

Under NZ Copyright Law, you can make copies of media you have purchased, 
including changing it to a digital format. You can then upload these songs to
Musi, which will treat your library of uploded music just like popular streaming
platforms treat their library.
